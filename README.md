# Learn `Golang`

Learn `Golang` to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

</div>

## _Why_?

`Go` is a great programming language 
if you want a good balance between simplicity,
beginner-friendliness (_being able to find/train new team members_)
and high performance.




### Why _Not_?

Common complaints/gripes developers have with `Go` include:
+ Error handling - this can be quite tedious 
see: https://medium.com/rungo/error-handling-in-go-f0125de052f0
+ Code duplication - some people complain about the lack of **inheritance** leading to code duplication. We think the benefits of 
+ Lack of metaprogramming - 
+ Operator overloading - a lack of [operator overloading](http://www.golangpatterns.info/object-oriented/operators)
can lead to more terse code. 

We feel all the issues (_with the exception of error handling_)
are actually _features_ of Go that lead to simpler more maintainable code.

> As noted in ["Why Elixir"](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/102)
`Go` is our 3rd Choice for programming languages. 
We use `Elixir` because Phoenix Channels makes Real Time _easy_ 
and `Nerves` makes building, deploying and maintaining IoT a _breeze_.
If `Elixir` didn't exist it would be a choice between `Rust` and `Go`.
`Go` is a _lot_ simpler and beginner-friendly. 
`Rust` is "safer" and more performant. 


## _What_?

> Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language 
designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
Go is syntactically similar to C, 
but with memory safety, 
garbage collection, 
structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency
The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.
~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)

## _Who_?

Anyone who wants to broaden their programming skills should learn `Go`.
The syntax is immediately familiar to anyone who has written a `C`-style 
language such as `JavaScript`.

## _How_?

You can learn the basics of `Go` online: https://play.golang.org
But when it comes time to actually _run_ a program 
on your computer, you will need to install the compiler.
Visit: 
https://golang.org/doc/install
and select the installer for your operating system.

## Popularity?

Despite the simplicity and performance of `Go`, 
it's nowhere _near_ as used/known 
as Google would like you to believe.
For example it's not in the Top 10 languages on GitHub:
https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages

And it's used by fewer than 9% of developers (_who answered the survey_)
on StackOverflow.
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology
<img width="802" alt="stackoverflow-dev-survey-languages" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/87814783-4c3f8880-c85c-11ea-9b2a-c7e1c068491e.png">

Don't let these stats dissuade you.
The biggest reason `Go` is not as popular as `JavaScript`, `Python` or `PHP` 
is simply because the other languages got a _massive_ head start.
